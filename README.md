# TNGaming-web-fullstack

This is my open-source project to share with you guys about a game store market (including frontend, backend).
This project contains 3 folders:

- gamesStoreApi for backend.
- gamesstore for frontend.
- gamesStoreProduct is the complete project

# App Details

- Frontend : React JS - Redux
- Backend : Nodejs - Express
- Database: MongoDB

# Usage

Replacing your database in config db.json then Npm install to install all the dependencies, and npm run start to run app

# Issue

I stopped this project on April 26, because I got tired when working with everything (Frontend, Backend, Design) that maked this project grown very slow. I think it will be better for me to move on learning something new.
Thank you so much, I'm always welcome your contribute to this project.
